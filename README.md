# Migrating from GitHub
[![Please don't upload to GitHub](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/badge.svg)](https://nogithub.codeberg.page)

In the interest of supporting OSS and decentralization, I am in the process of moving all my repositories to open source alternatives.

To learn more about why:
* [Don't Upload Other People's Code To GitHub](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/)
* [Give Up GitHub!](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)

## Alternatives
* [Codeberg](codeberg.org/)
* [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)
* [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
